# Escorting System Project Plan

## üìå Project Overview

An escorting system where you can be either an **Escort** or a **Contractor**.

- **Escort:** Offers services, divided into three tiers:
  - Tier 1: Companion only
  - Tier 2: Play only
  - Tier 3: Game Night (Companion + Play)

- **Contractor:** Can search for and hire escorts.

## üöß Development Phases

### üß± Phase 1 ‚Äì Terminal-Based CRUD in Python
- Learn Python OOP principles
- Build a CLI-based application
- Focus on logic, persistence, and input handling

### üåê Phase 2 ‚Äì Django Web App + Deployment

#### Phase 2A ‚Äì Django Development
- Learn Django framework, models, views, templates
- Implement same features from Phase 1 in web format

#### Phase 2B ‚Äì Local Server Deployment
- Learn Apache/Nginx, systemd, local DNS via `/etc/hosts`
- Simulate production environment

## ‚è≥ Project Timeline Estimate (1 Day/Week)

| Phase | Duration       |
|-------|----------------|
| Phase 1 ‚Äì Terminal CRUD | 4‚Äì5 weeks        |
| Phase 2A ‚Äì Django Dev   | 6‚Äì8 weeks        |

## üß† Consistency Strategy

- Use **micro-tasks** per session (see below)
- Maintain a simple **learning log**
- Use weekly **retrospective** to reflect
- Focus on visible, small wins
- Optional: use Goblin Tools or physical task board

## üîß First 6 Weekly Micro-Tasks

### Week 1 ‚Äì Kickoff + Class Skeletons

- [ ] Create `User` base class with `name`, `id`
- [ ] Create `Escort` and `Contractor` subclasses
- [ ] Add `service_tier` attribute to `Escort`
- [ ] Print a list of sample escorts and their tiers

---

### Week 2 ‚Äì Service Tier and CLI Menu

- [ ] Create `ServiceTier` enum
