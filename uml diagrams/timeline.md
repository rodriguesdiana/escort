> **A timeline**, assuming 1 focused day (5–6 hours) per week:

## 🧱 **Phase 1 – Terminal-Based CRUD App in Python (4–5 weeks)**

**Goal:** Learn object-oriented programming and CRUD logic.

| Week   | Focus                                                                                                     |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1 | ✅ Plan app: define features, user roles (Escort, Contractor), and service tiers. Create class skeletons. |
| Week 2 | ✅ Implement classes, methods (CRUD), and in-memory data storage (lists/dicts).                           |
| Week 3 | ✅ Add input validation, CLI interface (menus), and error handling.                                       |
| Week 4 | ✅ Add simulated bookings, basic search/filter, and data persistence via files (e.g., `json`, `pickle`).  |
| Week 5 | 🧪 Optional: Write unit tests for models; refactor code structure (separate files/modules).               |

> **Checkpoint:** You now understand OOP and how to structure basic applications.

## 🌐 **Phase 2A – Django Web App Development (6–8 weeks)**

**Goal:** Learn Django framework, MVC/MVT pattern, models, views, templates.

| Week    | Focus                                                                                           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 6  | 🔧 Set up Django project, apps, and user models (escort/contractor split). Learn Django basics. |
| Week 7  | 🔍 Build escort CRUD (create/edit/delete profile & services). Use forms and templates.          |
| Week 8  | 🎯 Build contractor view/search functionality with service tier filters.                        |
| Week 9  | 📅 Implement booking logic (requests, accept/reject flow). Add Django admin setup.              |
| Week 10 | 💬 Add messaging or notifications (optional), profile images, and user feedback system.         |
| Week 11 | 🧪 Add form validation, permissions, and test core views and models.                            |
| Week 12 | 🎨 Add Tailwind or Bootstrap styling, polish UI, prepare project for deployment.                |

> **Checkpoint:** Full working Django app with major features and interface.

## 🌍 **Phase 2B – Local Server Deployment & Linux Fundamentals (2–3 weeks)**

**Goal:** Learn how to host a Django project with Linux tools.

| Week    | Focus                                                                                                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Week 13 | 🖥️ Set up local Linux server: configure Apache or Nginx with WSGI (e.g., Gunicorn/uWSGI).                               |
| Week 14 | 🌐 Set up DNS resolution using `/etc/hosts`; make the site accessible via `escort.test`. Add HTTPS with self-signed SSL. |
| Week 15 | ⚙️ Configure systemd service for automatic start. Add logs, simulate firewall and local network access.                  |
| Week 16 | 🚀 Final project test, documentation, and optional demo to yourself or others.                                           |

> **Final Result:** Web app deployed on a local server using Linux tools.

### 📌 Notes

* You can compress or expand time depending on how fast you learn and whether you spend more than 1 day occasionally.
* This timeline assumes **deep learning**, not just copying tutorials.
* You'll be job/project-ready in Django basics, OOP, and local deployment by the end.
