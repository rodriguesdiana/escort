### üéì Learning Tips

* **Phase 1:** Focus on class design (Escort, Contractor, Service), polymorphism (service tiers), and data structures.
* **Phase 2:** Explore Django‚Äôs admin panel, URL routing, views, templates, and models. Slowly integrate Django-specific features like `signals`, `middleware`, or `custom managers`.

## ‚úÖ Add These Requirements to Support Server and Infrastructure Learning

### üîß **New Non-Functional Requirements for Phase 2 (Deployment Focus)**

| # Cod | Requirement                                                                                   |

### üß± Your Updated Development Phases (Now with Infra Learning)

#### üåê **Phase 2 (Web App + Deployment)**

You now have *two sub-phases*:

* **2A: Django App Development** ‚Äì You build and test locally using `runserver`.
* **2B: Local Server Deployment** ‚Äì You set up Apache/Nginx, local DNS, and systemd service to simulate a production server.
